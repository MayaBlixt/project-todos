# Todos App
A responsive Todo App using styled react components, reducers and actions. 


## Accessibility and cross-browser testing 

Html validated with W3C validation service (http://validator.w3.org/) with no errors found.
Chrome lighthouse report was generated with the result: 78% Accessibility, 100% Best Practices and 100% SEO. 
Accessibility checked with Wave chrome plugin and no errors raised and with screenreader chromeVox with no errors.
Testing has been done in different browsers such as Edge, FireFox and Chrome in mobile, tablet and desktop views.

## Limitations

All blue level requirements achived: 
- Your app should list all todo tasks - completed or uncompleted
- You should be able to mark an uncompleted task as complete (and change it back to uncomplete)
- You should be able to add and remove tasks
- Your app should show a count of either all todos, or all uncomplete todos (or both)

No limitations that I am aware of.
