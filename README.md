# Todos App
A responsive Todo App react components and using reducers and actions. Built with web accessibility in mind.

## The process
  I used a main component App where I show two diffrent components InputForm (where the user can input a happy tought) and a MessageList (where all messages are diplayed and  can be liked). The MessageList component is generating information using props and updating status using react hooks. I used the map method to iterate through the data to generate the all the messages.

## Accessibility and cross-browser testing 

Html validated with W3C validation service (http://validator.w3.org/) with no errors found.
Chrome lighthouse report was generated with the result: 100% Accessibility, 100% Best Practices and 100% SEO. 
Accessibility checked with Wave chrome plugin and no errors raised and with screenreader chromeVox with no errors.
Testing has been done in different browsers such as Edge, FireFox and Chrome in mobile, tablet and desktop views.
